Text Automated Learning by Experience &amp; Empathy

## Introduction
Automated text learning we are doing with current NLP techniques are learning based on text occurrence statistics. This way to analyze text using current NLP techniques a lot of data is needed. This does not actually reflect how human learn languages. Human learn languages based on small sets of repeating texts that are then processed to create meaning. [TODO: add explanation about body parts here] In the process of creating meaning 2 things play a big role. The one is experience and the other is empathy. The meaning of experience here is that every text that was processed will help with the analysis of new texts to process. The meaning of empathy here is that the learning process needs to register human body parts with the text if possible.

## Theories
- Texts are representations of our perceptions based on what the sensors in our body received of the things happening to our body.
- Every sensors in our body register different things at different time. These registrations of different sensors will eventually build events. Events will eventually become words or part of words we use in our daily conversations.
- Along with the sensors that our body register, there are other things around those sensors that need to be taken into account on every event registrations, which are changes of time and space.

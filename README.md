# Talee
Text Automated Learning by Experience &amp; Empathy

## Introduction
Automated text learning we are doing with current NLP techniques are learning based on text occurrence statistics. This way to analyze text using current NLP techniques a lot of data is needed. This does not actually reflect how humans learn languages. Humans learn languages based on small sets of repeating texts that are then processed to create meaning. The learning processes of humans start by associating words with sensors in their body parts.

The purpose of Talee is to learn languages using the approach that humans have. This means that Talee will need a virtual body with virtual sensors on different body parts, that will be used to associate applicable words with. 

In the process of creating meaning 2 things play a big role. The one is experience and the other is empathy. The meaning of experience here is not the body experience, but rather that every text that was learned will help with the analysis of new texts to process. It also means that the meaning of learned texts can change when it gained new insights. 

As for empathy, it means that during understanding process of texts, there should be connection made between the texts and body parts whenever possible.

## Theories
### Basics of words creations
- Texts are representations of our perceptions based on what the sensors in our body received of the things happening to our body.
- Every sensors in our body register different things at different time. These registrations of different sensors will eventually build events. Events will eventually become words or part of words that we use in our daily conversations.
- Along with the sensors that our body register, there are other things around those sensors that need to be taken into account on every event registrations, which are changes of time and space.
- The choices of words humans have at the beginning of our life are limited based on what their parents(or guardians) use. These choices of words eventually grow once they learn new things or meet new people. The new texts learned are done by using words that are learned before.
- All texts that human learned are checked and verified with other humans. Every texts and the relations between texts are tested and verified before they become the truth.

### Grouping of words
- Once texts and relations between them are verified, the next step is to group the texts. Every grouping of texts are a result of probabilistic calculation.
- The meaning of a word in texts are determined by the surrounding words. The meaning also occurs once some contexts have been created. Without the contexts, the word is merely an indication of meaning probabilities.
- To build contexts humans use temporary models in their mind that keep changing until they are verified in conversations.
- Every word in texts will eventually be categorized. To be able to apply the categories, Talee needs to be "taught" what are the words categories in different sentences and conversations.
- In Talee temporary models are called thought models. And to simulate conversations, Talee uses sessions. In every session, there are sentences which will be called inputs.

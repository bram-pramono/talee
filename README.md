Text Automated Learning by Experience &amp; Empathy

## Introduction
Automated text learning we are doing with current NLP techniques are learning based on text occurrence statistics. This way to analyze text using current NLP techniques a lot of data is needed. This does not actually reflect how human learn languages. Human learn languages based on small sets of repeating texts that are then processed to create meaning. In the process of creating meaning 2 things play a big role. The one is experience and the other is empathy. The meaning of experience here is that every text that was processed will help with the analysis of new texts to process. The meaning of empathy here is that the learning process needs to register body parts with the text if there is any.

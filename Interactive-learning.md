# Simulated Interactive Language Learning (SILL)

Language are essential in order to transfer and capture meaning during interactions with other people (agents) within the social group. Therefore, learning language cannot be done by a single agent alone. Children learn language by interacting with other social agents that have obtained knowledge of the language structure agreed by the social group. Through the interactions, children collect data of possible linguistic expression sequences, receive feedback, and gain knowledge about the structures of the language of the social group.

Here, we will use the term *dialect* as the language set of the social group. In this language set, there are structures that emerged from the use of linguistic expressions in communication. This idea follows the usage-based theory of language acquisition by Tomasello(2003). The theory is based mainly in how children acquire language knowledge through the need to communicate and learn from interactions and the feedbacks given by the environment.

To capture the language learning process of children, it is necessary to simulate how children learn language. I believe that this is a very difficult task to achieve. However, there must be a learning architecture that can be designed to capture this process.
